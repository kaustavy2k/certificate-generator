# certificate-generator
A web-app for creating a certificate and authorizing a certificate

User whose name is present on the database will enter his/her name and their respective certificate will be generated.

Any 3rd party will not be able to get his/her certificate if his/her name is not already registered in the database.

Even if the 3rd party fakes the certificate, on scanning the qr code present on the certificate we will know if that user is verified or not

Frameworks used- Js, Nodejs, Expressjs, Mongodb and heroku deployment
